### About the BOP

[The BOP](https://github.com/blewis308/BOP-Keyboard) is a 6x20 ortholinear keyboard made by [fruitykeeb](https://www.fruitykeeb.xyz). The GB ran in May 2021. They keyboard itself is made with an FR4-Bottom-Plate and Standoffs. But I wanted a "real" case for it.

This case is designed to be as flat as possible, to reduce height of the keyboard for better typing. The bottom plate and the standoffs have to be removed. Only the top plate and PCB are used.

**Untested Detail:**
